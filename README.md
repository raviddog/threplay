# Readme

**Touhou Replay Manager** is a tool to help manage your Touhou replay files. It allows you to easily backup, restore and keep track of your replays and also serves as a unified game launcher.

## Features

- View and copy replays to and from a backup folder for each game

## Todo

- replay decryption and data viewer
- tracking unique replay files with MD5 sum and an SQLite database
- load game info from a separate non-hardcoded file, to allow for easy updates or fangames
- automatically launch the replay inside the game (doubt this one will happen)
- thcrap integration (highly unlikely, but would pretty much turn this into an all-in-one touhou hub)
