## Features

- Move, copy and rename replays to and from a backup folder for each game
- View replay data like player name, score, etc directly within the program for easier organisation of replays
- Launch the specified game executable
- Open the game folder, or either of the specified replay folders

## Todo

- applocale support for game launching
- load game info from a separate non-hardcoded file, to allow for easy updates or fangames
- tracking unique replay files with MD5 sum and an SQLite database
- thcrap integration (highly unlikely, but would pretty much turn this into an all-in-one touhou hub)
